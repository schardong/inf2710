Accordingly, some recent studies on software reliability have attempted to use existing models more effectively in practice (e.g., model selection and combination). However, it is not easy to identify which model is likely to make the most trustworthy predictions and to assign appropriate weights to models for the combination. The improper model selection or weight assignment often causes unsuccessful software reliability prediction in practice, which leads to cost/schedule overrun. In this paper, we propose a systematic reliability prediction framework which dynamically selects and combines multiple software reliability models based on the decision trees learning of multi-criteria. For the model selection, the proposed approach uses the empirical patterns of multi-criteria derived from models. Reduced error pruning decision tree identifies the models with the best predictive patterns and automatically assign a weight to each model. Then, the identified models fall into two groups according to the likelihood of over- or under-prediction, and the competitive models from each group are combined based on their given weights. From the evaluation results, our approach outperformed existing methods on average prediction accuracy.","2015-03","2016-04-04 11:25:25","2016-04-05 13:33:43","2016-04-04 11:25:25","236-244","","","101","","Journal of Systems and Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/XZZW4NRM/Park e Baik - 2015 - Improving software reliability prediction through .pdf; /home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/XXC3JKMU/S0164121214002878.html","","","Decision trees; Multi criteria; Software reliability prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such uncertainties lead to hundreds, even thousands, of possible scenarios that are supposed to be analyzed so an effective production strategy can be selected. Given this high number of scenarios, a technique to reduce this set to a smaller, feasible subset of representative scenarios is imperative. The selected scenarios must be representative of the original set and also free of optimistic and pessimistic bias. This paper is devoted to propose an assisted methodology to identify representative models in oil fields. To do so, first a mathematical function was developed to model the representativeness of a subset of models with respect to the full set that characterizes the problem. Then, an optimization tool was implemented to identify the representative models of any problem, considering not only the cross-plots of the main output variables, but also the risk curves and the probability distribution of the attribute-levels of the problem. The proposed technique was applied to two benchmark cases and the results, evaluated by experts in the field, indicate that the obtained solutions are richer than those identified by previously adopted manual approaches. The program bytecode is available under request.","2016-03","2016-04-04 11:25:25","2016-04-05 13:33:54","2016-04-04 11:25:25","67-82","","","88","","Computers & Geosciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/7ZQTI6VE/Meira et al. - 2016 - Selection of Representative Models for Decision An.pdf; /home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/D48VVDCU/S0098300415300893.html","","","Decision Analysis under Uncertainty; Optimization; Representative Model Selection; Uncertain Geological Models; UNISIM-I benchmark","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many representative selection methods have been proposed to select a subset from the database as representatives. However, current methods cannot guarantee that the selected subset could represent the global distribution of the entire dataset. In order to evaluate how well the subset represents the global distribution of the whole dataset, we use the distance metric: Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the distribution of the fake dataset reconstructed from the subset and the distribution of the true dataset. In this work, we propose a sparse modeling based method to select representatives. The proposed method formulates the representative selection problem as a discrete dictionary learning problem. Based on the assumption that the dataset can be approximately reconstructed by linear combinations of dictionary items, we design a two-step iterative representative selection algorithm, which can minimize this KL divergence. Experiments evaluate the proposed algorithm in several multimedia analysis applications, including image and video summarization, classification using representative images and classification using representative features, and our method is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods.","2014-09-02","2016-04-05 15:07:13","2016-04-05 15:07:13","2016-04-05 15:07:13","423-431","","","139","","Neurocomputing","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/54ZZTX8E/Wang et al. - 2014 - Representative selection based on sparse modeling.pdf; /home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/JU7H8RE9/S092523121400397X.html","","","Dictionary learning; Representative selection; Sparse modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop a modified Akaike information criterion (AIC), a modified Mallows’ C p criterion and a modified Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The penalty terms in these criteria are shown to be different from the usual terms. We prove that the modified BIC consistently selects the regressors and the number of breaks whereas the modified AIC and the modified C p criterion tend to overfit with positive probability. The finite sample performance of these criteria is investigated through Monte Carlo simulations and it turns out that our modification is successful in comparison to the classical model selection criteria and the sequential testing procedure robust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation.","2011-10-01","2016-04-04 11:25:25","2016-04-05 13:33:46","2016-04-04 11:25:25","218-238","","2","164","","Journal of Econometrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/TJUBBPQ3/Kurozumi e Tuvaandorj - 2011 - Model selection criteria in multivariate models wi.pdf; /home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/HBNMFMMQ/S0304407611000820.html","","","AIC; BIC; Information criteria; Mallows’ Cp; Structural breaks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Criterion approaches based on the residual sum of squares (RSS), such as the Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Deviance Information Criterion, or Mallows' Cp can be used to compare non-nested models to identify an optimal subset of covariates. Computational limitations arise when the number of observations or candidate covariates is large in comparing all possible combinations of the available covariates, and in characterizing the covariance of the residuals for each examined model when the residuals are autocorrelated, as is often the case in spatial and temporal regression analysis. This paper presents computationally efficient algorithms for identifying the optimal model as defined using any RSS-based model selection criterion. The proposed dual criterion optimal branch and bound (DCO B&amp;B) algorithm is guaranteed to identify the optimal model, while a single criterion heuristic (SCH) B&amp;B algorithm provides further computational savings and approximates the optimal solution. These algorithms are applicable both to multiple linear regression (MLR) and to response variables with correlated residuals. We also propose an approach for iterative model selection, where a single set of covariance parameters is used in each iteration rather than a different set of parameters being used for each examined model. Simulation experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the algorithms for regression models, using MLR and geostatistical regression as prototypical regression tools and BIC as a prototypical model selection approach. Results show massive computational savings using the DCO B&amp;B algorithm relative to performing an exhaustive search. The SCH B&amp;B is shown to provide a good approximation of the optimal model in most cases, while the DCO B&amp;B with iterative covariance parameter optimization yields the closest approximation to the DCO B&amp;B algorithm while also providing additional computational savings.","2013-04","2016-04-04 11:25:25","2016-04-05 13:34:21","2016-04-04 11:25:25","88-98","","","42","","Environmental Modelling & Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/M8SRRR4Z/Yadav et al. - 2013 - A backward elimination discrete optimization algor.pdf; /home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/NGM94QJ9/S1364815212003155.html","","","Algorithm; Branch and bound; Discrete optimization; Model selection; Spatio-temporal regression models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interaction of N-TIMP-1 with the catalytic domain of MMP-3 has been investigated by titration calorimetry and 15N NMR. Their unfavorable enthalpy of binding of +6.5 kcal mol−1 is unusual among protein–protein associations, deviates from structure-based prediction, and is compensated by a net entropy increase providing at least 18 kcal mol−1 of favorable free energy of binding at a 1 M reference state. The small heat capacity of binding agrees well with the heat capacity predicted from 65% of the surface buried on binding being polar, and suggests that the hydrophobic effect can account for only part of the entropy of binding. Using NMR, binding-induced changes in the backbone of N-TIMP-1 were checked as one possible source of conformational entropy changes. MMP binding slightly increases rigidity in some contact sites in TIMP-1 but increases mobility remotely in the otherwise rigid β-barrel core of N-TIMP-1, increasing 15N relaxation evidence of pico- to nanosecond and micro- to millisecond fluctuations of β-strands A–F. Residual dipolar couplings suggest dynamic deviations from X-ray coordinates of the complex. These suggest that the β-barrel has small backbone conformational fluctuations, while segments of strands βB, βE and βF might experience fluctuations only in their backbone environment. This is a distinctive example of affinity between two well-structured proteins being enhanced by increased conformational entropy in the reservoir of a folding core.","2003-03-28","2016-04-04 11:25:25","2016-04-05 13:33:45","2016-04-04 11:25:25","719-734","","3","327","","Journal of Molecular Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/X92R3QCK/Arumugam et al. - 2003 - Increased Backbone Mobility in β-Barrel Enhances E.pdf; /home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/7VKIZUE8/S0022283603001803.html","","","backbone dynamics; protein–protein interactions; residual dipolar couplings; structure-based thermodynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only the most competent ones are selected to classify a given test sample. This is achieved by defining a criterion to measure the level of competence of a base classifier, such as, its accuracy in local regions of the feature space around the query instance. However, using only one criterion about the behavior of a base classifier is not sufficient to accurately estimate its level of competence. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic ensemble selection framework using meta-learning. We propose five distinct sets of meta-features, each one corresponding to a different criterion to measure the level of competence of a classifier for the classification of input samples. The meta-features are extracted from the training data and used to train a meta-classifier to predict whether or not a base classifier is competent enough to classify an input instance. During the generalization phase, the meta-features are extracted from the query instance and passed down as input to the meta-classifier. The meta-classifier estimates, whether a base classifier is competent enough to be added to the ensemble. Experiments are conducted over several small sample size classification problems, i.e., problems with a high degree of uncertainty due to the lack of training data. Experimental results show that the proposed meta-learning framework greatly improves classification accuracy when compared against current state-of-the-art dynamic ensemble selection techniques.","2015-05","2016-04-05 15:07:13","2016-04-05 15:07:13","2016-04-05 15:07:13","1925-1935","","5","48","","Pattern Recognition","META-DES","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/36DR3P8P/Cruz et al. - 2015 - META-DES A dynamic ensemble selection framework u.pdf; /home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/77FA3MHS/S0031320314004919.html","","","Classifier competence; Dynamic ensemble selection; Ensemble of classifiers; Meta-learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
