S.","Ensemble based classification using small training sets : A novel approach","Computational Intelligence in Ensemble Learning (CIEL), 2014 IEEE Symposium on","","","10.1109/CIEL.2014.7015738","","Classification is a supervised learning technique typically uses two-thirds of the given annotated data set for training and the remaining for test. In this paper, we developed a frame work which uses less than one-third of the data set for training and tests the remaining two-thirds of the data and still gives results comparable to other classifiers. To achieve good classification accuracy with small training sets, we focused on three issues: The first is that, one-third(30%) of the data should represent the entire data set. The second is on increasing the classification accuracy even with these small training sets, and the third issue is on taking care of deviations in the small training sets like noise or outliers. First issue is addressed by proposing three methods: divide the instances into 10 bins based on their distances from the centroid, based on their distance from a reference point 3/2(min+max) and a distribution specific binning. In all these methods, training sets are formed using stratified sampling approach which ensures that the samples chosen are from the entire distribution. Second issue is dealt with using the concept of ensemble based weighted majority voting for classification. Third issue is tackled by implementing four filters on training sets. The filters used are Removing Outliers using Inter Quartile Range option (available in Weka) and removing misclassified instances applying Naive Bayes, IB3, IB5 as filters. Experiments are conducted on seven binary andmulti-class data sets taking only 6% to 18% of the total data for training and implemented the proposed three methods without any filters for noise and outlier removal and with them too on the training sets.We compare our results with two popular ensemble methods ada-boost and bagging ensemble techniques, ENN, CNN, RNN instance selection methods. Empirical analysis shows that our three proposed methods yield comparable classification results to those available in literature which use smal- training sets.","2014-12","2016-04-04 11:15:54","2016-04-04 16:54:35","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","accuracy; ada-boost; annotated data set; Bagging; bagging ensemble technique; Bayes methods; binary class data set; classification accuracy; CNN instance selection method; Computational modeling; Data models; distribution specific binning; empirical analysis; ENN instance selection method; ensemble based classification; ensemble based weighted majority voting; Ensemble method; IB3; IB5; inter quartile range option; learning (artificial intelligence); misclassified instance; multiclass data set; naive bayes; noise; outlier removal; pattern classification; Prototypes; reference point; Representative set; RNN instance selection method; sampling methods; Stratified sampling; stratified sampling approach; supervised learning technique; Training; training set; Training Set Selection Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the latter the assignment rule for the new nodes is based on a model learned in the training phase. We propose a method to extract from a network a small subgraph representative for its overall community structure. We use a model selection procedure based on the modularity statistic which is novel, because modularity is commonly used only at a training level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on synthetic networks and benchmark data from real networks (power grid network and protein interaction network of yeast).

The actual design of a thermal protection system can be chosen to vary the level of heating reduction, and associated weight, across the structure. This paper considers how such designs and resulting thermal gradients influence the ability to achieve closed-loop performance. A control architecture is used that damps any thermal effects for a range of temperature profiles. Various designs are considered for a representative model to show the large variation in flight dynamics. The resulting closed-loop performance is characterized as a function of the induced thermal gradients to indicate the optimality of the designs.","2009-06","2016-04-04 10:53:51","2016-04-04 10:53:51","","2513-2518","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5160180&action=search&sortType=&rowsPerPage=&matchBoolean=true&searchField=Search_All&queryText=(.QT.Representative%20Model.QT.%20AND%20(Clustering%20OR%20Optimization))&newsearch=true","","Aerodynamics; aircraft control; closed-loop performance; closed loop systems; control-oriented analysis; Control systems; Design optimization; Engines; Feedback; Heating; heating reduction; hypersonic flight; hypersonic vehicle; missile control; Open loop systems; Protection; Temperature control; thermal gradients; thermal protection system; Vehicle dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Control Conference, 2009.

In this work, we propose a joint key-frame extraction and object segmentation method by constructing a unified feature space for both processes, where key-frame extraction is formulated as a feature selection process for object segmentation in the context of Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based video modeling. Specifically, two divergence-based criteria are introduced for key-frame extraction. One recommends key-frame extraction that leads to the maximum pairwise interclass divergence between GMM components. The other aims at maximizing the marginal divergence that shows the intra-frame variation of the mean density. The proposed methods can extract representative key-frames for object segmentation, and some interesting characteristics of key-frames are also discussed.

The method is based on representing the system buses as modules and the connecting branches as nets. The number of nets connecting each pair of modules is chosen to be a function of either a single electrical property or a normalised combination of several properties of the equivalent branch connecting the pair of buses. A heuristic approach, based on the approximation of the constrained network partitioning problem into a linear transportation problem, is used to cluster the network into S clusters each containing m buses. The use of a linear-time bus interchange algorithm provides the best possible cluster configuration. The solution technique provides complete freedom in choosing the electrical properties of the greatest importance to the clustering application. Consequently, the selectivity of the proposed solution technique in the aspect of choosing the electrical connectivity measure is evident","1997-05","2016-04-04 10:53:55","2016-04-04 10:53:55","","279-284","","3","144","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=588360&action=search&sortType=&rowsPerPage=&matchBoolean=true&searchField=Search_All&queryText=(.QT.Representative%20Model.QT.%20AND%20(Clustering%20OR%20Optimization))&newsearch=true","","constrained network partitioning problem; electrical connectivity measure; electrical properties; equivalent branch connection; heuristic approach; linear-time bus interchange algorithm; linear transportation; power network clustering; power network model; power systems; representative model; single electrical property","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, the technical and economical limits of wind power integration within the power system are highlighted, by means of observing and analyzing various unit commitment schedules under different scenarios. The main question refers to which level of wind penetration the power system can operate in a safe and reliable fashion, while the incoming wind power is completely integrated and correlations between system variables in adjacent areas are taken into account. By answering this question, the system planner will have the flexibility to arrange in the future the power system operation accordingly so as to decrease the operation costs to a minimum and increase the efficiency of the total system to maximum.

Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to view-based 3-D object retrieval for its advantage of using 2-D views to represent 3-D objects. In this paradigm, typically the retrieval is accomplished by matching the views of the query object with the objects in database. However, using all the query views may not only introduce difficulty in rapid retrieval but also degrade retrieval accuracy when there is a mismatch between the query views and the object views in the database. In this work, we propose an interactive 3-D object retrieval scheme. Given a set of query views, we first perform clustering to obtain several candidates. We then incrementally select query views for object matching: in each round of relevance feedback, we only add the query view that is judged to be the most informative one based on the labeling information. In addition, we also propose an efficient approach to learn a distance metric for the newly selected query view and the weights for combining all of the selected query views. We conduct experiments on the National Taiwan University 3D Model database, ETH 3D object collection, and Shape Retrieval Content of Non-Rigid 3D Model, and results demonstrated that our approach not only significantly speeds up the retrieval process but also achieves encouraging retrieval performance.","2011-10","2016-04-04 11:09:37","2016-04-04 16:54:45","","1007-1018","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2D views; 3-D object retrieval; 3D object retrieval scheme; Cameras; Computational modeling; Databases; ETH 3D object collection; feature extraction; Intelligent query; multi-view; National Taiwan University 3D Model database; nonrigid 3D model shape retrieval content; pattern clustering; query processing; query view clustering; query view selection; Radio frequency; relevance feedback; representative query view; Solid modeling; solid modelling; Three dimensional displays; view matching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since hydrodynamic variables are closely related to metallurgical and economical performances of the unit, the implementation of such a control strategy is crucial to optimize its operation. The hydrodynamic variables here considered are the gas hold-up in the collection zone and the fraction of wash-water underneath the interface. They are controlled by manipulating gas flow rate and wash-water flow rate respectively. Hydrodynamic variables are controlled through a constrained model predictive control (MPC) strategy. This choice is dictated by the interdependency of these controlled variables and the capability of predictive controllers to handle process constraints. Identification tests lead to a representative model of the system under nominal operating conditions but indicate variations of process behavior with changing operating regimes. Results show good control performances, confirming the potential use of MPC to control hydrodynamic variables for real-time optimization of full-scale flotation columns.","2012-06","2016-04-04 10:53:55","2016-04-04 10:53:55","","4022-4027","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6315113&action=search&sortType=&rowsPerPage=&matchBoolean=true&searchField=Search_All&queryText=(.QT.Representative%20Model.QT.%20AND%20(Clustering%20OR%20Optimization))&newsearch=true","","air-water-ore; Conductivity; constrained model predictive control; Feeds; flotation (process); gas flow rate; Hydrodynamics; hydrodynamic variables; industrial environment; Mathematical model; mining; multivariable control systems; multivariable predictive control; pilot flotation column; predictive control; predictive controllers; process behavior; real-time optimization; Sensors; three-phase system; wash-water flow rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Control Conference (ACC), 2012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J.","Robust crowdsourced learning","2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data","","","10.1109/BigData.2013.6691593","","In general, a large amount of labels are needed for supervised learning algorithms to achieve satisfactory performance. It's typically very time-consuming and money-consuming to get such kind of labeled data. Recently, crowdsourcing services provide an effective way to collect labeled data with much lower cost. Hence, crowdsourced learning (CL), which performs learning with labeled data collected from crowdsourcing services, has become a very hot and interesting research topic in recent years. Most existing CL methods exploit only the labels from different workers (annotators) for learning while ignoring the attributes of the instances. In many real applications, the attributes of the instances are actually the most discriminative information for learning. Hence, CL methods with attributes have attracted more and more attention from CL researchers. One representative model of such kind is the personal classifier (PC) model, which has achieved the state-of-the-art performance. However, the PC model makes an unreasonable assumption that all the workers contribute equally to the final classification. This contradicts the fact that different workers have different quality (ability) for data labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called robust personal classifier (RPC), for robust crowdsourced learning. Our model can automatically learn an expertise score for each worker. This expertise score reflects the inherent quality of each worker. The final classifier of our RPC model gives high weights for good workers and low weights for poor workers or spammers, which is more reasonable than PC model with equal weights for all workers. Furthermore, the learned expertise score can be used to eliminate spammers or low-quality workers. Experiments on simulated datasets and UCI datasets show that the proposed model can dramatically outperform the baseline models such as PC model in terms of classification accuracy and ability to detect spammers.","2013-10","2016-04-04 10:53:33","2016-04-04 10:53:33","","338-343","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6691593&action=search&sortType=&rowsPerPage=&matchBoolean=true&searchField=Search_All&queryText=(.QT.Representative%20Model.QT.%20AND%20(Clustering%20OR%20Optimization))&newsearch=true","","Accuracy; CL; classification accuracy; crowdsourced learning; crowdsourcing; crowdsourcing services; data labeling; expertise score; final classification; labeled data; Labeling; learned expertise score; learning (artificial intelligence); Logistics; low-quality workers; Noise measurement; Optimization; pattern classification; PC; personal classifier model; robust crowdsourced learning; robustness; robust personal classifier; RPC; simulated datasets; spammers; supervised learning; supervised learning algorithms; Training; ubiquitous computing; UCI datasets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The atlas is built up from MRI stacks, obtained with a 1.5 T imager which is able to produce a 1.5 mm resolution. The proposed approach allows the authors to obtain an anatomical average, keeping the different brain structures. The anatomical deformations are generated by a modified version of the non-linear Marquardt-Levenberg optimization method and a bidimensional affine transformation using four parameters. The process is carried out in a local way by subdividing the image in regions to provide anatomical deformations using a rigid transformation. It is assumed that the brain structures have been previously segmented and rigidly registered. In order to reduce the discontinuities appearing when reconstructing the resulting image, a cubic B-spline interpolation was used.

With the advent of multilayer PCB technology, one can have many interconnection planes along with VCC and ground planes. This multilayer technique reduces the interconnect length considerably. However, this increases the interconnect density and thereby decreases the interconductor spacing. This gives rise to the possible electromagnetic interference which in turn causes crosstalk voltage.

Sensor data transmitted to a remote base station within the network arrive subject to node location, orientation, and movement. Power is optimally allocated to all channels using a novel resource efficient algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based on a computationally efficient min-max model predictive controller that uses an uncertain linear state-space model of the tracking error that is estimated via local received signal strength feedback. An explicit solution for the power controller is computed offline using a multiparametric quadratic solver. It is shown that the proposed design leads to a robust control law that can be implemented quite readily on a commercial sensor node platform where computational and memory resources are extremely limited. The design is validated using a fully IEEE 802.15.4 compliant testbed using Tmote Sky sensor nodes mounted on fully autonomous MIABOT Pro miniature mobile robots. A repeatable representative selection of scaled ambulatory scenarios is presented that is quite typical of the data that will be generated in this space. The experimental results illustrate that the algorithm performs optimal power assignments, thereby ensuring a balance between energy consumption and a particular outage-based quality of service requirement while robustly compensating for disturbance uncertainties such as channel fading, interference, quantization error, noise, and nonlinear effects.","2014-12","2016-04-04 11:15:54","2016-04-05 13:33:24","","1060-1073","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/3WIPU56F/display.html","","ambient healthcare environment; ambulatory wireless sensor networks; Ambulatory wireless sensor networks (WSNs); channel fading; commercial sensor node platform; disturbance uncertainties; energy consumption; fading channels; fully autonomous MIABOT Pro miniature mobile robots; IEEE 802.15.4; IEEE 802.15.4 compliant testbed; IEEE 802.15 Standards; IEEE standards; minimax techniques; min-max model predictive control approach; min-max model predictive controller; min???max model predictive control (MPC); min–max model predictive control (MPC); min-max model predictive control (MPC); multiparametric programming; multiparametric quadratic solver; node location; node movement; node orientation; nonlinear effects; optimal power assignments; outage-based quality of service; piecewise-affine function; power control; power controller; power system management; predictive control; quality of service; quantization error; received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based power control; repeatable representative selection; resource-constrained wireless sensor; resource-constrained wireless sensors; resource efficient algorithm; robust control; robust control law; Robustness; robust power management; scaled ambulatory scenarios; sensor data; Sensors; telecommunication channels; telecommunication control; Tmote Sky sensor nodes; tracking error; uncertain linear state-space model; Wireless communication; wireless sensor networks","Ambulatory wireless sensor networks (WSNs); IEEE 802.15.4; min-max model predictive control (MPC); multiparametric programming; piecewise-affine function; received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based power control; resource-constrained wireless sensor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A feature selection method is required to be general enough to find representative features from training data, which are then used for classifying test patterns. The situation where the features selected from the training data are quite different from the representative features of the testing data is called over-selecting. The main causes of the over-selecting phenomenon are: non-comprehensive consideration of statistical properties of the training data, heuristic search strategies for feature selection and small sample size of the data set for training. In this paper, we show the influence of the over-selecting phenomenon on the over-fitting phenomenon of machine learning algorithms. We propose a new framework to address principal causes of over-selecting and thus reduce the chance of over-fitting. Our new framework that we call Ensemble Feature Selection measure (EnFS), allows to consider many statistical properties of a given data set at the same time by combining many feature selection methods used in the filter model. From the chosen feature selection measures, a new combined measure is constructed. We also propose a new search algorithm that ensures the globally optimal feature subsets by means of the constructed measure. The new search approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming (M01LP) problem by means of the branch-and-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear in the number of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our EnFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application. Experimental results obtained over the KDD CUP'99 benchmarking data set for IDS show that our EnFS measure is capable of reducing over-fitting by addressing over-selecting.","2011-11","2016-04-04 11:15:54","2016-04-04 16:54:18","","213-218","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","branch-and- bound algorithm; Computational modeling; correlation-based feature selection; EnFS measure; ensemble feature selection measures; feature extraction; globally optimal feature subsets; heuristic search strategy; intrusion detection; Intrusion Detection System; learning (artificial intelligence); linear programming; linear programming problem; machine learning algorithm; Machine learning algorithms; mixed 0–1 integer linear programming; mixed 0-1 integer linear programming; noncomprehensive consideration; over fitting phenomenon; Pattern Recognition; pattern recognition system; polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming; polynomial mixed 0–1 fractional programming; Polynomials; Programming; representative feature; security of data; set theory; statistical property; Testing; test pattern classification; Training; Training data; tree searching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed method is performed using three steps: extract the affective features from the input image, cluster images in the affective space and rank the clusters, and find representative images within each cluster. First, the probabilistic affective model is used to transform the images into the affective space. Thereafter, the images are clustered in the affective space. Then, the selected canonical images are representative and distinctive from each other. Thus, we define three prominent properties that an informative summary should satisfy: coverage, affective coherence, and distinctiveness. Based on these, cluster ranking is performed. Finally, the representative images for each cluster are selected, all of which are displayed as canonical images to the user. Experiments using web image databases demonstrate are not only representative but also exhibit a diverse set of views with minimal redundancy.","2015-07","2016-04-04 11:09:37","2016-04-04 16:54:39","","360-367","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","affective coherence; canonical images; Canonical image selection; cluster images; cluster ranking; coverage; distinctiveness; human affects; Image color analysis; image representation; informative summary; Internet; pattern clustering; photographic images; probabilistic affective model; probability; representative images; Semantics; viewpoint; visual databases; visual features; Web image databases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such comments contain valuable information for other customers, but are usually difficult to utilize due to the lack of common description structure, the complexity of opinion expression and fast growing data volume. Comment-based restaurant summarization is even more challenging than other types of products and services, as users' comments on restaurants are usually mixed with opinions on different dishes but attached with only one overall evaluation score on the whole experience with the restaurants. It is thus crucial to distinguish well-made dishes from other lousy dishes by mining the comment archive, in order to generate meaningful and useful summaries for other potential customers. This paper presents a novel approach to tackle the problem of restaurant comment summarization, with a core technique on the new bilateral topic analysis model on the commentary text data. In the bilateral topic model, the attributes discussed in the comments on the dishes and the user's evaluation on the attributes are considered as two independent dimensions in the latent space. Combined with new opinionated word extraction and clustering-based representation selection algorithms, our new analysis technique is effective to generate high-quality summary using representative snippets from the text comments. We evaluate our proposals on two real-world comment archives crawled from the most popular English and Chinese online restaurant review web sites, Yelp and Dianping. The experimental results verify the huge margin of advantage of our proposals on the summarization quality over baseline approaches in the literature.","2015-04","2016-04-04 11:09:37","2016-04-04 16:54:31","","483-494","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Algorithm design and analysis; analytical models; bilateral topic analysis; catering industry; Chinese online restaurant review Web sites; clustering-based representation selection algorithm; comment-based restaurant summarization; computational complexity; Correlation; data mining; dish comment summarization; English online restaurant review Web sites; fast growing data volume; hidden Markov models; high-quality summary; Internet; online services; opinionated word extraction; opinion expression complexity; Proposals; representative snippets; text analysis; Vocabulary; Web 2.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the existing key frame based summarization approaches represent individual frames with global features, which neglects the local details of visual content. Considering that a video generally depicts a story with a number of scenes in different temporal order and shooting angles, we formulate scene summarization as identifying a set of frames which best covers the key point pool constructed from the scene. Therefore, our approach is a two-step process, identifying scenes and selecting representative content for each scene. Global features are utilized to identify scenes through clustering due to the visual similarity among video frames of the same scene, and local features to summarize each scene. We develop a key point based key frame selection method to identify representative content of a scene, which allows users to flexibly tune summarization length. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed approach is very promising and potentially robust to clustering based scene identification.","2012-07","2016-04-04 11:09:37","2016-04-04 16:55:33","","570-575","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","#64257; analytical models; cation; clustering; Clustering algorithms; clustering based scene identification; frame identification; global features; key frame based summarization approach; key point based key frame selection method; Keypoint pool; local features; NASA; pattern clustering; Redundancy; representative content identification; Robustness; Scene identi&amp; scene summarization; Semantics; shooting angles; summarization length tuning; temporal order; two-step process; video content; video frame; video signal processing; video summarization; visualization; visual similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
