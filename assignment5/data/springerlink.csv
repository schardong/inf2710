Accordingly, some recent studies on software reliability have attempted to use existing models more effectively in practice (e.g., model selection and combination). However, it is not easy to identify which model is likely to make the most trustworthy predictions and to assign appropriate weights to models for the combination. The improper model selection or weight assignment often causes unsuccessful software reliability prediction in practice, which leads to cost/schedule overrun. In this paper, we propose a systematic reliability prediction framework which dynamically selects and combines multiple software reliability models based on the decision trees learning of multi-criteria. For the model selection, the proposed approach uses the empirical patterns of multi-criteria derived from models. Reduced error pruning decision tree identifies the models with the best predictive patterns and automatically assign a weight to each model. Then, the identified models fall into two groups according to the likelihood of over- or under-prediction, and the competitive models from each group are combined based on their given weights. From the evaluation results, our approach outperformed existing methods on average prediction accuracy.","2015-03","2016-04-04 11:25:25","2016-04-05 13:33:43","2016-04-04 11:25:25","236-244","","","101","","Journal of Systems and Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/XZZW4NRM/Park e Baik - 2015 - Improving software reliability prediction through .pdf; /home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/XXC3JKMU/S0164121214002878.html","","","Decision trees; Multi criteria; Software reliability prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We prove that the modified BIC consistently selects the regressors and the number of breaks whereas the modified AIC and the modified C p criterion tend to overfit with positive probability.

Currently there exist two families of methodologies that ensemble candidate SPODEs for classification. One is to select only helpful SPODEs and uniformly average their probability estimates, a type of model selection. Another is to assign a weight to each SPODE and linearly combine their probability estimates, a methodology named model weighing. This paper presents a theoretical and empirical study comparing model selection and model weighing for ensembling SPODEs. The focus is on maximizing the ensemble’s classification accuracy while minimizing its computational time.

However, such data, particularly in the presence of covariates, often lead to models that either fit the data poorly, are exceedingly general and hard to interpret, or are specified in a manner that is highly data dependent. This article introduces methods for developing parsimonious models for such data. The underlying technology uses reduced-rank representations of the variances, covariances and means of observed and latent variables. The value of this approach, which may be implemented using standard structural equation modeling software, is illustrated in an application study aimed at understanding heterogeneous consumer preferences. In this application, the parsimonious representations characterize systematic relationships among consumer demographics, attitudes and preferences that would otherwise be undetected. The result is a model that is parsimonious, illuminating, and fits the data well, while keeping data dependence to a minimum.","2012-03-09","2016-04-04 10:53:20","2016-04-04 10:53:20","2016-04-03 16:28:42","358-387","","2","77","","Psychometrika","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","","http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11336-012-9260-x","","Assessment, Testing and Evaluation; conjoint analysis; consumer preferences; LU decomposition; matrix approximation; multilevel latent variable models; multilevel models; Psychometrics; random coefficients; random effects; reduced-rank regression; second-order factor analysis; singular value decomposition; Statistical Theory and Methods; Statistics for Social Science, Behavorial Science, Education, Public Policy, and Law; structural equation models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Criterion approaches based on the residual sum of squares (RSS), such as the Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Deviance Information Criterion, or Mallows' Cp can be used to compare non-nested models to identify an optimal subset of covariates. Computational limitations arise when the number of observations or candidate covariates is large in comparing all possible combinations of the available covariates, and in characterizing the covariance of the residuals for each examined model when the residuals are autocorrelated, as is often the case in spatial and temporal regression analysis. This paper presents computationally efficient algorithms for identifying the optimal model as defined using any RSS-based model selection criterion. The proposed dual criterion optimal branch and bound (DCO B&amp;B) algorithm is guaranteed to identify the optimal model, while a single criterion heuristic (SCH) B&amp;B algorithm provides further computational savings and approximates the optimal solution. These algorithms are applicable both to multiple linear regression (MLR) and to response variables with correlated residuals. We also propose an approach for iterative model selection, where a single set of covariance parameters is used in each iteration rather than a different set of parameters being used for each examined model. Simulation experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the algorithms for regression models, using MLR and geostatistical regression as prototypical regression tools and BIC as a prototypical model selection approach. Results show massive computational savings using the DCO B&amp;B algorithm relative to performing an exhaustive search. The SCH B&amp;B is shown to provide a good approximation of the optimal model in most cases, while the DCO B&amp;B with iterative covariance parameter optimization yields the closest approximation to the DCO B&amp;B algorithm while also providing additional computational savings.","2013-04","2016-04-04 11:25:25","2016-04-05 13:34:21","2016-04-04 11:25:25","88-98","","","42","","Environmental Modelling & Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/M8SRRR4Z/Yadav et al. - 2013 - A backward elimination discrete optimization algor.pdf; /home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/NGM94QJ9/S1364815212003155.html","","","Algorithm; Branch and bound; Discrete optimization; Model selection; Spatio-temporal regression models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interaction of N-TIMP-1 with the catalytic domain of MMP-3 has been investigated by titration calorimetry and 15N NMR. Their unfavorable enthalpy of binding of +6.5 kcal mol−1 is unusual among protein–protein associations, deviates from structure-based prediction, and is compensated by a net entropy increase providing at least 18 kcal mol−1 of favorable free energy of binding at a 1 M reference state. The small heat capacity of binding agrees well with the heat capacity predicted from 65% of the surface buried on binding being polar, and suggests that the hydrophobic effect can account for only part of the entropy of binding. Using NMR, binding-induced changes in the backbone of N-TIMP-1 were checked as one possible source of conformational entropy changes. MMP binding slightly increases rigidity in some contact sites in TIMP-1 but increases mobility remotely in the otherwise rigid β-barrel core of N-TIMP-1, increasing 15N relaxation evidence of pico- to nanosecond and micro- to millisecond fluctuations of β-strands A–F. Residual dipolar couplings suggest dynamic deviations from X-ray coordinates of the complex. These suggest that the β-barrel has small backbone conformational fluctuations, while segments of strands βB, βE and βF might experience fluctuations only in their backbone environment. This is a distinctive example of affinity between two well-structured proteins being enhanced by increased conformational entropy in the reservoir of a folding core.","2003-03-28","2016-04-04 11:25:25","2016-04-05 13:33:45","2016-04-04 11:25:25","719-734","","3","327","","Journal of Molecular Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/X92R3QCK/Arumugam et al. - 2003 - Increased Backbone Mobility in β-Barrel Enhances E.pdf; /home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/7VKIZUE8/S0022283603001803.html","","","backbone dynamics; protein–protein interactions; residual dipolar couplings; structure-based thermodynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, several variable selection approaches have been developed and used to help us select significant variables and construct a parsimonious model simultaneously. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of model selection approaches in the context of penalized least squares. We then review independence screening, a recently developed method for analyzing ultrahigh-dimensional data where the number of variables or parameters can be exponentially larger than the sample size. Finally, we discuss and advocate multistage procedures that combine independence screening and variable selection and that may be especially suitable for analyzing high-frequency financial data. Penalized least squares seek to keep important predictors in a model while penalizing coefficients associated with irrelevant predictors. As such, under certain conditions, penalized least squares can lead to a sparse solution for linear models and achieve asymptotic consistency in separating relevant variables from irrelevant ones. Independence screening selects relevant variables based on certain measures of marginal correlations between candidate variables and the response.","2015","2016-04-04 10:53:33","2016-04-04 10:53:33","2016-04-03 16:28:42","2093-2118","","","","","","","","","","","Springer New York","","en","©2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/gschardong/.zotero/zotero/nah1hk19.default/zotero/storage/HT897MEX/2015_model-selection-high-dim_huang.pdf; ","http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-7750-1_77","","Dimension reduction; Econometrics; Finance, general; Generalized correlations; High-dimensional data; Independence screening; LASSO; Model selection; Oracle property; Penalized least squares; Quantitative Finance; SCAD penalty; Shrinkage; Statistical learning; Statistics for Business/Economics/Mathematical Finance/Insurance; Ultrahigh-dimensional data; Variable selection","Lee, Cheng-Few; Lee, John C.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In most clustering algorithms an all-vs-all root mean square deviation (RMSD) comparison is performed. Most of the time is typically spent on comparison of non-similar structures. For sets with more than, say, 10,000 models this procedure is very time-consuming and alternative faster algorithms, restricting comparisons only to most similar structures would be useful. Results We exploit the inverse triangle inequality on the RMSD between two structures given the RMSDs with a third structure. The lower bound on RMSD may be used, when restricting the search of similarity to a reasonably low RMSD threshold value, to speed up similarity searches significantly. Tests are performed on large sets of decoys which are widely used as test cases for predictive methods, with a speed-up of up to 100 times with respect to all-vs-all comparison depending on the set and parameters used. Sample applications are shown. Conclusions The algorithm presented here allows fast comparison of large data sets of structures with limited memory requirements. As an example of application we present clustering of more than 100000 fragments of length 5 from the top500H dataset into few hundred representative fragments. A more realistic scenario is provided by the search of similarity within the very large decoy sets used for the tests. Other applications regard filtering nearly-indentical conformation in selected CASP9 datasets and clustering molecular dynamics snapshots.
