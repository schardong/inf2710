\maketitle

Our work has two possible qualitative research subquestion stated as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What methods are used to select the percentile models in oil companies?
\item What defines a good set of percentiles?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Is there a way to measure how good each set was?
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

These questions can be answered by interviewing oil engineers. The questions to be asked will be very similar to the research subquestions stated above. Our goal is to discover how do they choose the percentile models and how do they tell a good selection from a poor one.

This process is intended to guide the quantitative analysis of our work. If there is a measure of how good a set of percentiles is, we may use this measure to compare our proposed approach with the ones used by these engineers and even other approaches found in the literature.
