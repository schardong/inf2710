  abstract =  {Prototype methods seek a minimal subset of samples that can serve as a distillation or condensed view of a data set. As the size of modern data sets grows, being able to present a domain specialist with a short list of “representative” samples chosen from the data set is of increasing interpretative value. While much recent statistical research has been focused on producing sparse-in-the-variables methods, this paper aims at achieving sparsity in the samples.

We discuss a method for selecting prototypes in the classification setting (in which the samples fall into known discrete categories). Our method of focus is derived from three basic properties that we believe a good prototype set should satisfy. This intuition is translated into a set cover optimization problem, which we solve approximately using standard approaches. While prototype selection is usually viewed as purely a means toward building an efficient classifier, in this paper we emphasize the inherent value of having a set of prototypical elements. That said, by using the nearest-neighbor rule on the set of prototypes, we can of course discuss our method as a classifier as well.

We demonstrate the interpretative value of producing prototypes on the well-known USPS ZIP code digits data set and show that as a classifier it performs reasonably well. We apply the method to a proteomics data set in which the samples are strings and therefore not naturally embedded in a vector space. Our method is compatible with any dissimilarity measure, making it amenable to situations in which using a non-Euclidean metric is desirable or even necessary.},

  Abstract                 = {Time series clustering is an active research area with applications in a wide range of fields. One key component in cluster analysis is determining a proper dissimilarity measure between two data objects, and many criteria have been proposed in the literature to assess dissimilarity between two time series. The R package TSclust is aimed to implement a large set of well-established peer-reviewed time series dissimilarity measures, including measures based on raw data, extracted features, underlying parametric models, complexity levels, and forecast behaviors. Computation of these measures allows the user to perform clustering by using conventional clustering algorithms. TSclust also includes a clustering procedure based on p values from checking the equality of generating models, and some utilities to evaluate cluster solutions. The implemented dissimilarity functions are accessible individually for an easier extension and possible use out of the clustering context. The main features of TSclust are described and examples of its use are presented.},
